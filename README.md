This repository is a remake of MaterialCraft. Credit for MaterialCraft goes to the original author, Sid Engel, but a multitude of changes have been made to separate this repository from the original in terms of design. Most features planned for future updates of the original template have been added. 

A demo of the the redesigned template can be found on [our GitHub pages site](https://artex-development.github.io/MaterialCraft).

The following is the README.md file from the original repository.
